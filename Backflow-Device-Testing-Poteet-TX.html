<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
