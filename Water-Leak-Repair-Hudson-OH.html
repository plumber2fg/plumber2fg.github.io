Lots of clogs are brought on by putting too much toilet tissue into the bowl. Be aware of just how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever put any paper item into the toilet bowl aside from toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or trigger a clog even more down the drainpipe.
