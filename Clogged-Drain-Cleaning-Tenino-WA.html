<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close.
