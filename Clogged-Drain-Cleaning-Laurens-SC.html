When the tank leaks, your water heater is dead. The telltale sign that your hot water heater needs changing is a sluggish drip below, usually showing up as a path of rusty water. This implies that the steel tank has actually rusted through and can't be repaired.

We have portable electrical systems for within your house or business and big gas and trailer units for outside issues.
