<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
