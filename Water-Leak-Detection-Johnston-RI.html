Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
<p>Many toilets used today run with a standard gravity flushing design, indicating they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system.
