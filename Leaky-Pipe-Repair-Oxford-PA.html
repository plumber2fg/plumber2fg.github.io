<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may very well become part of your job requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which brings in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure called, ion exchange).
