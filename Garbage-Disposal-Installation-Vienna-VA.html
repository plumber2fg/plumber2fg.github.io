The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
