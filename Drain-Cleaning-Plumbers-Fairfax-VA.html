<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Inspect the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show.
