<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Southport NC</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater. To guarantee that we are offering high-quality work and consumer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to standard hot water heater, we also install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
