<p>You can find lots of repair guidelines on the internet, so the first thing you need to know is that for anything beyond an irritating drip-drip-drip you need to close the shutoff valves below to conserve water and safeguard versus the leak all of a sudden worsening while you're asleep or away. You must also understand that other than for cosmetically patching a chip in the porcelain and sealing around the joint, there's not much to repair on the sink itself; an issue will mean a sink replacement.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close.
