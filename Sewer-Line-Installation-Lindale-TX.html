<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leakages come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
