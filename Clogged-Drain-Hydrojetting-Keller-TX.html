If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you ought to require to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
