The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement.

Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape.
