These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
<p>In community water system systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or organisation.
