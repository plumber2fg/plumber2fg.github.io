<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
