<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

It likewise saves you money and time due to the fact that a second inspection isn't essential.</p>
