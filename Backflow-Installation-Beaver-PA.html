<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to determine if and in some cases where a leak has happened in systems which consist of gases and liquids. The majority of pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices generally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction includes safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. A lot of apprentices go into a program straight, but some start out as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
