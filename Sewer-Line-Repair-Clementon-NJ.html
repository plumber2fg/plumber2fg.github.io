<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 on average depending upon the length from the main gas line. Setting up a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
