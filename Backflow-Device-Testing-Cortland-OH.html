<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is suggested to check the manufacturer's guidelines for unique safety measures.</p>
