<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
