<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
