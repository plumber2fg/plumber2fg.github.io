<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
