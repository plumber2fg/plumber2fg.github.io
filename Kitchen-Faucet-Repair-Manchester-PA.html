<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it might wreak undesirable problems on your property.

To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
