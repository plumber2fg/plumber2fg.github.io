<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
