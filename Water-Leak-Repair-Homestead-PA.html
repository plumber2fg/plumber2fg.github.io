<p>If and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which consist of gases and liquids, Pipeline leak detection is utilized to identify. The majority of pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices generally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction includes safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. The majority of apprentices get in a program straight, however some begin as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
