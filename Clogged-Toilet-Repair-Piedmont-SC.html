<p>Tough water can leave your hair looking dull and dry and your skin feeling scratchy and flakey, which's just what it does to your body. In your house, tough water mineral build-up on showerheads and faucets causes them to lose efficiency and function, and etching and finding on your glasses makes it look like you never even ran the dishwasher.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
