<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
