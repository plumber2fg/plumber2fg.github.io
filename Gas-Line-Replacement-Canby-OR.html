<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
