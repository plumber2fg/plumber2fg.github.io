<p>If you are upgrading your gas devices, you should upgrade the piping as well. Gas leaks can be dangerous and scary. We're here for you every step of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Like any major appliance, your hot water heater will begin to use down and show indications of aging.

To fix the basic clogged drain problem, we will utilize a drain snake to latch onto any blockages and fish them out. The snake is pushed through the drain line up until it reaches the blockage, removing it. A drain snake is a agile and long device, which can suit even the smallest of pipes.</p>
