<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the start of our home improvements. George and Anthony did an incredible task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our home. I will always use them and ask for George particularly for all future issues or repairs. They were timely and provided excellent prices for what we required done. I extremely recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide cleansed water. The energy source needed to heat up the water is less costly. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be removed relatively quickly by utilizing an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Where the company is located: Beware of contractors who offer you a post workplace box with no street address or usage just an answering service. Never ever employ somebody who comes unsolicited to your door and can't offer you proof of qualifications-- especially if she or he pressures you to work with quickly and pay money up front. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check prevents backflow brought on by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing.</p>
