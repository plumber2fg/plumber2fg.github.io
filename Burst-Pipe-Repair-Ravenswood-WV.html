<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Ravenswood WV</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An approved, effectively installed and kept backflow assembly basically removes the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.
