<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands additional detergent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher stained and spotted. Filmy residue builds up on your shower drapes and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in hard water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair lifeless and sticky. The sheer amount of time, money, and energy required to tidy up the destructive side effects of hard water is excessive. A whole house water softener is the solution to the scourge of water solidity.</p>
