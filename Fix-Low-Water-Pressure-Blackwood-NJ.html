<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Blackwood NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
