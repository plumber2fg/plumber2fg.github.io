<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
