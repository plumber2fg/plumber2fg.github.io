The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down lead to a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
