For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>
