<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is entirely odorless. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you ought to require to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>Plumbing by Jake has a proven record of 5-star service. We employ just the best hot water heater technicians, we appear on time, and we make sure you get exactly what you need-- whether from your existing hot water heater or a new installation. Numerous obstructions are brought on by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Understand just how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never put any paper item into the toilet bowl aside from toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog even more down the drainpipe. Feminine hygiene products need to be disposed of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
