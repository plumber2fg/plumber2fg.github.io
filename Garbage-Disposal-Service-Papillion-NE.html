<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they usually take place in the lowest open drain. This kind of problem is typically the result of a clog in the line. If you don't find the odor coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this problem due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
