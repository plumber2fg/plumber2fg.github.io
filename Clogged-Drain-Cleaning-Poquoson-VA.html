<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
