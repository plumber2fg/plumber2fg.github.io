Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. Most homes use continuous feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is turned on.
