<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly susceptible to repeating pinhole leaks (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping.

All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized.

This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
