I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

If these connections are not properly secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.
