<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to determine if and in some cases where a leak has actually taken place in systems which contain gases and liquids. The majority of plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical guideline, each year. Technical guideline includes safety, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. The majority of apprentices enter a program directly, however some start out as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
