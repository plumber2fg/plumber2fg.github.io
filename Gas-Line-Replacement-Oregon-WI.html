<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Oregon WI</h3>

I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
