<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things in a different way might have saved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
