<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Mapleton UT</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
