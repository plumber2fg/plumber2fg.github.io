<p>Those people in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have actually significantly lowered the variety of reported events that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in individuals thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both counterproductive and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow defense.
