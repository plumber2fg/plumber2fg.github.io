<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in many scenarios to install a pipe segment of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
