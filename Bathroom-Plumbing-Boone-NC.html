<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
