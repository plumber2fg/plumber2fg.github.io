<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>

When one immediately starts regrowth after adding salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of strategies has been issued and the assembly has actually been set up, it should be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then accountable to license that the installation was performed in accordance with authorized strategies; or describe any changes or submit "As Developed" plans as suitable.</p>
