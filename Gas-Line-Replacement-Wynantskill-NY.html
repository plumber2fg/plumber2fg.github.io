I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.

This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
