<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Audubon NJ Experts</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your house.</p>
