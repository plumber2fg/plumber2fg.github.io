<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Livingston TX</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
