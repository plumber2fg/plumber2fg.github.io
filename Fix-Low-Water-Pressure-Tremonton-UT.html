<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Tremonton UT</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
