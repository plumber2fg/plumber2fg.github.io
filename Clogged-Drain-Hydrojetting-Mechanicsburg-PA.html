<p>Irrigation backflow devices are designed for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect versus both back-siphonage and back-pressure of infected water into the potable water supply. While there's not an exact timetable regarding when you should repipe your house, you should definitely check out repiping if they haven't been performed in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older house constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe just what was incorrect with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any issues you may have.</p>

<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any location where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't enable the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer may spit or spill water out of under the cap when backflow occurs, so it needs to be set up in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
