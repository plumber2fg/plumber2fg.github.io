<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things in a different way could have saved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

This is particularly real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
