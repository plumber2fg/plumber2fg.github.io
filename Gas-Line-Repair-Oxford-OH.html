<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing license prior to installing or changing a backflow preventer. Your water heater. The pro will next inspect your water heater. With your water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance task that avoids hard water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>

<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect.

Regrettably, mainline clogs are usually much bigger clogs than require more than easy unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
