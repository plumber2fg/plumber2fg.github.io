Technical instruction includes security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Most apprentices get in a program straight, but some begin as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
