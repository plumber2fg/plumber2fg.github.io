<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
