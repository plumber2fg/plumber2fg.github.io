<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of damaging contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment containing a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a process known as backflow.</p>

<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they normally take place in the most affordable open drain. This type of problem is usually the result of a clog in the line.

Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
