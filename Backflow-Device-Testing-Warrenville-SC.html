<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>A basic repair or replacing private parts may be all that's needed to get your water heater working once again if you have a more recent system.

While this may operate in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the very same material as other pipes in your house, meaning that difficulty could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you assurance and prevent bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>
