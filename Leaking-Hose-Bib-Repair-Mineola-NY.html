<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater away from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home. If you're replacing an old disposal, you'll need to remove it prior to setting up the new one. For garbage disposal repair and maintenance services in Des Moines, call Principle Plumbing, Heating & Cooling at (515) 305-2955 today.

<p>Nevertheless, this cost can as much as double when streets, pathways, driveways or utilities lie above the broken pipe. Displacing or restoring these ground-level components can run traditional pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single task.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink.

If you have a big family or do a great deal of cooking, you might consider a 1 HP waste disposal unit.</p>
