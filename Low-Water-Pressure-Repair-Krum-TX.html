<p>A freshly installed hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate considerably for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
