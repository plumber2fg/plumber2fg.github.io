<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A totally various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
