Since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a difference in the lives of many house owners in The United States and Canada and around the world. Our premium system, the EC4 entire house water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that uses a procedure of ion exchange to get rid of the minerals that trigger tough water. By replacing the magnesium, calcium, and bicarbonate ions that cause water firmness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by resolving its source. Additionally, thanks to its special, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your common water usage patterns, changing its soft water shipment based upon your requirements. In this method, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an unlimited supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to decrease these symptoms.</p>
